// Requirements:
// * Display just the names and titles of persons from the mock-data.csv file
// * The names & titles must be stored in a struct separately from the mock
//   data for potential later usage
// * None of the mock data may be duplicated in memory
//
// Notes:
// * The mock data has already been loaded with the include_str! macro, so all functionality
//   must be implemented using references/borrows

const MOCK_DATA: &'static str = include_str!("mock-data.csv");
