// Summary:

// * Each piece of luggage has a tracking id
// * Luggage goes through multiple states at the airport:
//   * Check-in        (passenger gives luggage to airport)
//   * OnLoading       (luggage is loaded onto correct plane)
//   * Offloading      (luggage is taken off plane at destination)
//   * AwaitingPickup  (luggage is at destination waiting for passenger pickup)
//   * EndCustody      (luggage was picked up by passenger)
// Notes:
// * Optionally use generics for each state
