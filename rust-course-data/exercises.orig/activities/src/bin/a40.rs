// Topic: Smart Pointers & RefCell
//
// Summary:
//   A vehicle rental company wants to access the rentals available
//   at storefront locations. Create a program that provides access
//   to storefront rentals from the corporate headquarters.
//
// Requirements:
// * Corporate must be able to access the rentals at a storefront
// * Storefronts must be able to rent out vehicles
// * Rentals have the following attributes:
//   - Type of vehicle
//   - Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
//   - Vehicle status:
//     * Available, Unavailable, Maintenance, Rented
//
// Notes:
// * Use Rc and RefCell to create shared mutable data structures
// * Create at least two rentals and ensure that Corporate and StoreFront
//   can both access the rental information
// * Test your program by changing the vehicle status from both a storefront
//   and from corporate

struct Corporate;

struct StoreFront;

fn main() {}
